An overview of the files and R functions used for extracting DEGs, creating Differentially Co-Expressed Networks, and selecting key genes from these networks will be provided in detail.

- GBM_TRAIN.Rmd: RMarkdown file in which the analysis of DEGS, DCE and keygenes is performed.
- GBM_TRAIN.pdf: Report file of the analysis of DEGS, DCE and keygenes.
- TMMbyHand.R: The R file contains the functions to extract TMM normalization parameters and to normalize test sets.
- funzioni.R: File that contains all the functions used to perform DCN analysis.


I've also inserted the files:
- "Dati-di-test-GSE183635".Rmd
- "Dati-di-test-GSE183635".pdf
- "Dati-di-test-GSE156902".Rmd
- "Dati-di-test-GSE156902".pdf

These files are not intended to be part of the thesis; they are poorly commented and organized. However, they contain useful information about how the test datasets are built and normalized, so I decided to include them just for reference.
