An overview of the files and R functions used for extracting DEGs, creating Differentially Co-Expressed Networks, and selecting key genes from these networks will be provided in detail.

- GBM_TRAIN.Rmd: RMarkdown file in which the analysis of DEGS, DCE and keygenes is performed.
- GBM_TRAIN.pdf: Report file of the analysis of DEGS, DCE and keygenes.
- TMMbyHand.R: The R file contains the functions to extract TMM normalization parameters and to normalize test sets.
- funzioni.R: File that contains all the functions used to perform DCE analysis.
