An overview of the files and R functions used for extracting DEGs, creating Differentially Co-Expressed Networks, and selecting key genes from these networks will be provided in detail.

- GBM_TRAIN.Rmd: RMarkdown file in which the analysis of DEGS, DCE and keygenes is performed.
- GBM_TRAIN.pdf: Report file of the analysis of DEGS, DCE and keygenes.
- TMMbyHand.R: The R file contains the functions to extract TMM normalization parameters and to normalize test sets.
- Funzioni.R: File that contains all the functions used to perform DCE analysis.
- parametriTMM_BRCA.RData: RData file that contains TMM  normalization parameters for BRCA condition.
- parametriTMM_CRC.RData: RData file that contains TMM  normalization parameters for CRC condition.
- parametriTMM_GBM.RData: RData file that contains TMM  normalization parameters for GBM condition.
- parametriTMM_NSCLC.RData: RData file that contains TMM  normalization parameters for NSCLC condition.
- parametriTMM_PAAD.RData: RData file that contains TMM  normalization parameters for PAAD condition.
